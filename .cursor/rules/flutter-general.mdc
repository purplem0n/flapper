- lib/features/chat/ -> example of a Chat feature
- lib/features/chat/models/ -> dart data class goes in this folder
- lib/features/chat/data -> network repository layer goes here - AVOID ABSTRACT CLASSES. IT'S JUST UNNECESSARY LAYER
- lib/features/chat/widgets/ -> widget components in the feature goes here
- lib/features/chat/bloc -> the core bloc folder of the feature. contains bloc, state and event classes.
